# SmallProjects
A repository for small projects I've completed during my programming journey.

The projects are organised as: "file", "relevant field". 

## Python:
- nimGame.py, game theory : a simulation of a multi-heap pick-up-sticks/nim game where the user plays against a singular opponent who will always make a winning move if in a winning state.
